# sensors

Sketches to drive two Etherten Arduino clones used as part of the mapping for a performance project where capturing the performer's movement and their interaction with props was captured using sensors and communicated to a server process (over a closed ethernet LAN) that assembled pre-written text fragments by reacting to parameters: heat, cold, light, dark, silence, noise - and the presence of the performer in defined regions of the stage space (using proximity detectors).
